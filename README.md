# Foodgram
Fall 17 CS498RK - The Art of Web Programming Final Project

Video Introduction: https://youtu.be/zzx-pv6K97I  

In this day and age, there are many food related applications that help people find recipes to cook. However, there aren't many apps that allow for the social media aspect to finding recipes. This is why we created Foodgram, a database-backed web application which utilizes a RESTful API. Foodgram offers an interactive platform for chefs and enthusiasts of all different levels to search and learn about recipes while connecting with one another. Users can sign up for an account and keep track of their favorite recipes, follow other users who’s recipes they enjoy, and even create their own recipes to share.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repo
2. cd into Foodgram directory
3. Run the command: `npm install`
4. cd into frontend directory
5. Run the command: `npm install`
6. cd back into Foodgram directory
7. Run the command: `npm start`
8. Check to see if dependencies in npm_installs.txt are all installed
9. In browser, view frontend at `localhost:3000` and backend at `localhost:4000`
10. Sign in using test user (sghuang2, password)

## Project Guidelines
Create a database-backed web application which utilizes a RESTful API with the following constraints:
- Your team may only consist of 4 people, with each person having a specific role.
- Your project must be a web application that has a frontend, an API, JavaScript backend, and at least one database.
- Your project needs to have user authentication.
- Your project needs to have a heuristic evaluation with at least one revision. Make sure you plan time for this.
- Your project must have a strong focus on design, primarily in user experience (UX), user interface (UI), and responsiveness.

## Project Deliverables
1. Source Code for the Project / URL to GitHub Repository
2. URL to your hosted project
3. No longer than 3-minute video detailing your web app’s purpose, design, and functionality
4. Peer evaluation

## Project Grading
1. Proposal/prototypes (10%)
2. Video (15%)
3. Design (UX, UI, responsiveness, evaluation) (35%)
4. Front end implementation (15%)
5. Back end implementation (15%)
6. User authentication (10%)

## Video Criteria
1. 3-minutes length max
2. Should focus on design and functionality
3. Use screen capture software
4. Demo the important user flows
5. Voice-over should tell a concrete story: user, problem, and how your app solves it
